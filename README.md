### Stress classification with various machine learning libraries

This school project aims to explore machine learning algorithms through the use of SVM (scikit) and deep learning (keras, tensorflow).
Physiological data samples will be provided by the E4 *Empatica* wristband.

### Introduction

Few years ago, a SVM model has been developed to classify stress levels according to physiological data.
The main aim of the project is to develop a model to see how well the deep learning approach can do in comparison of the svm approach.
In addition of this, the old dataset we have to work with hasn't been properly labelized - a new data collection is thus part of the project.
The old model will obviously use the same dataset to get relevant performance comparison.

### Tensorflow vs Keras

Keras uses tensorflow - it can be seen a a higher level library using tf - and will shortly be integrated to it. 
It can be used to quickly create complex models with very little code. Tensorflow can be seen more as a *language* than a framework, providing his own syntax to develop machine learning models.

  * Proper implementation with the actual database
	
2. Deep Learning approach
  * Familiarization with Deep Learning key concepts
  * Familiarization with Tensorflow and Keras libraries
  * Keras / Tensorflow comparison
  * Discussion of the final choice between Keras and Tensorflow

3. Getting data
  * Stress workshop planning
  * Actual data collection
	
4. Accuracy comparison 
  * Figuring a way to compare algorithms performance (False negative, false positive, etc.) 
  * Some visual representations
  * Preparing data for visualization
  * Coordination with the team
	
5. Documentation
  * Sphinx documentation
