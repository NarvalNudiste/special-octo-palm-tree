### Stress classification with various machine learning libraries

This school project aims to explore machine learning algorithms through the use of SVM (scikit) and deep learning (keras, tensorflow).
Physiological data samples will be provided by the E4 *Empatica* wristband.

### Requirements (will obviously subject to change) 

1. SVM approach
  * Familiarization with Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Various tests with sci-kit's SVM classifier on provided sample data (Iris, Digits)
  * First implementation with small E4 datasets
  * Finding an algorithm in order to determine best C/Gamma values
  * Proper implementation with the actual database
	
2. Deep Learning approach
  * Familiarization with Deep Learning key concepts
  * Familiarization with Tensorflow and Keras libraries
  * Implementation of E4 data with Tensorflow / Keras
	
3. Getting data
  * Stress workshop planning
  * Actual data collection
	
4. Accuracy comparison 
  * Figuring a way to compare algorithms performance (False negative, false positive, etc.)
  * Some visual representations I guess
	
5. Documentation
  * Sphinx documentation
